## About me:
My main goal is to become a highly skilled programmer. To achieve this, I work hard and study in-depth the relevant training materials. I believe that diligence and persistence are important personal qualities for success.
Previously, I have worked as a supervisor in a steel mill and a police officer in a special operations unit. Additionally, I have experience as a boxing coach, which has given me a broad understanding of different professional fields.
